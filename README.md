<h1>Dog Walking</h1>  
<h2>Description</h2>
I created this sketch using JavaScript. It features my eldest pup, Cookie. 

In this sketch, I utilized the draw function and if conditionals to bring Cookie to life on the screen. The user can interact with the sketch by helping Cookie cross the street using the scroll wheel on their mouse. It was a fun and challenging project that allowed me to showcase my programming skills while also incorporating my love for my furry friend.<br />   

<h2>Controls</h2>
Mouse click: To change the traffic light. <br/>
Mouse Wheel: To walk Cookie.
